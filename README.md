Hello! 
My name is Francesca and I have been living in Detroit for the past 7 years and working in the hotel and restaurant industry. I have started to focus more on what I want to do next and personal development. That lead me to data analytics, app development and project management. I am hoping to use my decade of experience in hospitality management to bring a new point of view to the tech sector.
